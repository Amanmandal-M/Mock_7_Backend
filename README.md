Note: 

- Before doing anything first create `.env` file and put `PORT` , `MONGO_URL` , `NORMAL_KEY`.
- `PORT` is for listening the server.
- `MONGO_URL` is for running database and store your data in database so put your mongo link.
- `NORMAL_KEY` is for authentication jsonwebtoken so basically this is your secret key .
